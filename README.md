## Project Pitch:

## Summary:

Bringing back the glory of the old traditional snake game  by building a more user interactive version, by detecting hand gestures from a web cam to control movement of the snake on the screen.                 

## Problem Domain:

To upgrade the snake game to be more interactive with the player, this will make the game 10 times more fun to play.  However, our real mission is to develop a model that can control and change some functionalities on the screen according to external or outsider influence, although our model will be applied to a simple logic based game, the basic concept is to be able to read hand gestures from the web cam, thus it can be evolved to bigger applications like controlling a video or playing a more complex game.
