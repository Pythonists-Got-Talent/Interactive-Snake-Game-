## Project Name: The Luxurious Interactive Snake Game

### Summary:

Bringing back the glory of the old traditional snake game  by building a more user interactive version, by detecting hand gestures from a web cam to control movement of the snake on the screen. 

### Vision

Our vision is to develop a model that can control and change some functionalities on the screen according to external or outsider influence, although our model will be applied to a simple logic based game, the basic concept is to be able to read hand gestures from the web cam, thus it can be evolved to bigger applications like controlling a video or playing a more complex game. 

### User Stories:

1. As a user I want to play the snake game.
2. As a user I want the model to track my hand.
3. As a user I want the snake to move according to my hands movements.
4. As a user I want to see my final score.
5. As a user I want to see an interactive and fun GUI for the game.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:

The MVP is to build the traditional snake with good GUI, and to be able to do simple image processing as per minimum.
